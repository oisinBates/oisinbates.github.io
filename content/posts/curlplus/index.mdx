This script allows the user to run a series of curl commands against single or multiple urls.

The user can choose to either run the script on a single url or a list of urls. When executed, the script first checks the syntax of the parameters it has been passed, before running a series of curl commands on the urls(s).


### Example Usage
`curlplus [number of requests OR source file] [url{if no source file}]`


### Sample Output
```txt
  oisin@oisin-ThinkPad-T430:~/curlplus$ ./curlplus.sh urllist.txt
