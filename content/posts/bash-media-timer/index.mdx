### Overview: 
This project was a solution to a personal predicament; I enjoyed the convenience of playing music on a timer via my home stereo, but I often found myself away from home with only my laptop. Of course, there are many possible solutions to this use case, I chose Bash as it offered an opportunity to work with a scripting language which I had not been taught in college.

This script plays radio and music files on a timer as part of a bedtime routine, logging user habits to a MySQL database. It takes two parameters:

`$1`: Length in minutes for playing radio.
`$2`: Length of time the user wishes to sleep for(in hours, up to two decimal places permitted).

### Script Structure:

1. Regular expressions check both paramters to ensure that they are not in violation. Script exits at this point if parameters don't match regexs.
2. Radio begins playing(via google-chrome web browser). Thread sleeps for the period of time specified in $1.
3. Machine suspends to ram for the length of time specified in $2(minus $1).
4. Machine boots up and plays an alarm. A random album of music is queued to play from the local drive.
5. MySQL database updated.

Additionally, a MySQL event is scheduled to generate weekly averages, which are inserted to a seperate table of averages
